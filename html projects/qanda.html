<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> Hey, Ethan, why does this page look so good? You're like a professional!
<strong>
<br>
<em>Answer:</em></strong> Well, as you can see, I am a professional.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> How did you get so smart?
<strong>
<br>
<em>Answer:</em></strong> I go to Liu-Liu Coding class on Sunday mornings and a math training camp on Sunday afternoons. 
Although those classes are pretty easy for me, I learn a lot from them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> What do you do in your free time? You seem too smart too take any breaks!
<br>
<strong><em>Answer:</em></strong> Well, I sometimes play Minecraft with my sister and father. I also watch YouTube with my sister.
However, I do spend most of my time studying and growing the wrinkles on my brain. </p>
