<h2 id="head"> About</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Ethan and I am extremely smart. I go to a math training camp and I can get 100% on any AIME competition in just 5 minutes. I learned how to code this website 
with the help of my father, in weekly Liu-Liu Coding classes. I also use the app M1MO to help me in my projects. I hope that one day, I can make really cool projects with 
code.</p>
<h2 id="head">Description</h2>
<p>This right here is my very first project. This project is basically just me testing out some new coding elements that I learn. It is also a website about me!
I know that many of you are probably blown away by my website, and I understand. Even more astounding, this is just my very first project! Just imagine how 
mind-blowing my future projects will be! Feel free to explore this amazing website and give me some feedback! If you don't like it, <a href="https://google.com" class="GoAway">go away</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="head">Future Expectations</h2>
<p>Here are some future expectations from my projects:
<ul id="list">
    <li>There will be more variety (not just websites)</li>
    <li>More content</li>
    <li>Potential collabs</li>
    <li>Better-looking websites/games</li>
</ul>
